I picked a task at work that seemed very simple. It is a fairly greenfield project and we needed better errors output for one of our GraphQL api mutations.

## The Problem

As with any greenfield project, execution is not going to be the best at the first try. This function had to do a couple of things in order to complete that involved calling many services. If any of these service calls fail we need to perform cleanups so we can try again and not have collisions with successful jobs completed in the next run.

The way this workflow was built was that we would wrap all of the services in a try catch and perform jobs sequentially.

```javascript
async function doTheThing(args) {
  if (!(await validateArgs(args)))
    return {code: 'INVALID_ARGS', message: 'Args are invalid'}

  try {
    await handleA()
    await handleBAndC()
    return {success: true}
  } catch (error) {
    await cleanupAll()
    return {code: error.code, message: error.message}
  }
}
```

I added the error that my mutation would return and now my task is complete. I noticed there were a couple of holes in this implementation however.

1. If `handleA` fails and `handleBAndC` would fail, we would have to fix whatever cause that error to happen in `handleA`, run the operation again and _then_ is whe we discover that `handleBAndC` also had an error. These jobs don't have to happen sequentially as none of these services impact the outcome of the next.
2. We have a single try/catch for all and we attempt to perform a cleanup on all the services. That means that even if the first service fails we will attempt to cleanup everything even though there is nothing to cleanup.

At this point I am at a crossroads. I could just keep this change and move my task to the "done" column _or_ improve this a bit.

1. We could execute these services in parallel, collect all the errors and return them so users can fix all these and try again rather than fixing them one by one in the order they happen.
2. Cleanups could be performed on only services that were successfully completed rather than trying to cleanup everything at once.

These two changes would also improve the response times of this mutation. Sounds like there a lot to gain from a change like this, so let's do it!

## Enter XState

Before I even attempt to rewrite what is already in place and working I want to be 100% sure that the logic I'm about to write satisfies all of the possible outcomes.

Based on the mock function from earlier, there's four states:

1. Validating
2. Calling services
3. Success (final state)
4. Failure (final state)

And I need to keep track of successful jobs as well as collect all errors that may happen along the way. The initial setup for our state machine looks like this:

```javascript
const doTheThingMachine = Machine({
  id: 'do-the-thing',
  initial: 'validating',
  states: {
    validating: {},
    handlingThings: {},
    success: {
      type: 'final',
    },
    failure: {
      type: 'final',
    },
  },
})
```

<XStateViz gist="193168562f73b5fd0aa6122ef08e801f" />

Now let's think about state transitions. Our initial state is going to be validating, which matches that first `if` statement in our function for validating the arguments. If arguments are valid, I want to call my services and if they are not we will transition to the failure state.

```javascript
const doTheThingMachine = Machine({
  // ...
  states: {
    validating: {
      invoke: {
        src: 'validateArgs',
        onDone: 'handlingThings',
        onError: {
          target: 'failure',
          actions: 'invalidArgsError',
        },
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

<XStateViz gist="fbd8d2c80587677f159152e175b3835b" />

We are going to call a service using the `invoke` configuration option on the state node. Upon entering `validateArgs` we are going to invoke a service that will validate our arguments. If arguments are valid, we transition to `handlingThings` and if hey are invalid we would transition to the `failure` state and also perform a `invalidArgsError` action that could just add an error to an errors array on the machine context.

The `handlingThings` state is composed of two parallel processes. Parallel state nodes expose an `onDone` property that will perform a state transition that will get triggered once all of its child nodes have reached their final states.

Each parallel state child node has to be a final state which for simplicitly sakes I'll call `complete`. No matter what happens here, whether it is successful or failed I will always transition to `complete`. The only difference will be that I will trigger different actions depending on the outcome.

```javascript
const doTheThingMachine = Machine({
  // ...
  states: {
    // ...
    handlingThings: {
      type: 'parallel',
      onDone: [
        {target: 'success', cond: 'noErrorsHappened'},
        {target: 'cleaningUp'},
      ],
      states: {
        thingOne: {
          initial: 'handlingA',
          states: {
            handlingA: {
              invoke: {
                src: 'handleA',
                onDone: {
                  target: 'complete',
                  actions: 'handleASuccess',
                },
                onError: {
                  target: 'complete',
                  actions: 'handleAError',
                },
              },
            },
            complete: {
              type: 'final',
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

<XStateViz gist="d133412bfa9d9b6b57dd88a26dfae7f5" />

Lots of new things here. Let's disect this.

- The `type: 'parallel'` property makes the `handlingThings` a parallel state node.
- The `onDone` configuration will transition conditionally to the `success` or the `failure` states.
  - This resembles an `if/else` statement. If there are no errors, transition to `success` otherwise transition to `failure`.
  - In the `failure` transition we are going to call the `performCleanups` action.
- For the `handlingA` invocation both `onDone` and `onError` transition to the `completed` state, but I set different actions for both. I would keep track of errors and successful jobs with these actions.

We are going to make a change to the way we complete the `handleBAndC` job. Since `C` depends on the result of `B`, we are going to have to model this in a sequential way.

```javascript
const doTheThingMachine = Machine({
  // ...
  states: {
    // ...
    handlingThings: {
      // ...
      states: {
        thingOne: {
          // ...
        },
        thingTwo: {
          initial: 'handlingB',
          states: {
            handlingB: {
              invoke: {
                src: 'handleB',
                onDone: {
                  target: 'handlingC',
                  actions: 'handleBSuccess',
                },
                onError: {
                  target: 'complete',
                  actions: 'handleBError',
                },
              },
            },
            handlingC: {
              invoke: {
                src: 'handleC',
                onDone: {
                  target: 'complete',
                  actions: 'handleCSuccess',
                },
                onError: {
                  target: 'complete',
                  actions: ['handleCError', 'cleanupB'],
                },
              },
            },
            complete: {
              type: 'final',
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

Whenever `B` is done, we are going to use that output to handle `C`. If the former fails, we can't execute the latter. We can also make an improvement here to speed up execution times and if `C` happens to fail we are going to cleanup `B`.

Now that our machine is ready, we are going to replace our current implementation with our machine.

## Implementing the machine

We are going to use the `interpret` function from the XState library and attach a listener for when the machine transitions states. Our function would look like this now.

```javascript
import {doTheThingMachine} from './doTheThingMachine'
import {interpret} from 'xstate'

async function doTheThing(args) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    interpret(doTheThingMachine)
      .onTransition((state) => {
        // state.done is true once the machine reaches its final state
        // our doTheThingMachine final states are 'success' and 'failure'
        if (state.done) {
          if (state.matches('failure')) {
            // collect errors
            // we could save these errors on the machine's context
            // const { errors } = state.context;
            // resolve({ errors });
          }
          resolve({success: true})
        }
      })
      .start()
  })
}
```

## Testing the machine

One of the things I liked the most about building this with XState is that I am no longer writing both the logic and the implementation together. Instead, I built the logic first, and then added the funcitonality.

Since all the services are stubbed we can easily mock them and test our logic. With XState, we are able to make this separation of concerns more easily which results in testing pure logic easily.

```javascript
// doTheThingMachine.spec.js
import {doTheThingMachine} from './doTheThingMachine'
import {interpret} from 'xstate'

const mockActions = {
  // ...
}
const mockServices = {
  validateArgs: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
  handleA: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
  handleB: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
  handleC: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
}

test('should succeed if all services resolve correctly', (done) => {
  const testMachine = doTheThingMachine.withConfig({
    actions: mockActions,
    services: mockServices,
  })

  interpret(testMachine)
    .onTransition((state) => {
      if (state.done) {
        expect(state.matches('success')).toBe(true)
        done()
      }
    })
    .start()
})
```

Here we just mocked our services so they end up resolving correctly and what we want to test is that the final state is `success`.

Similarly, we would need to mock the services to reject rather than resolve and test that the final state reached is the `failure` state.

```javascript
// doTheThingMachine.spec.js

test('the final state should be "failure" if handle{A,B,C} fails', (done) => {
  const testMachine = doTheThingMachine.withConfig({
    actions: mockActions,
    services: {
      ...mockServices,
      handleA: jest.fn(() => Promise.reject()),
    },
  })

  interpret(testMachine)
    .onTransition((state) => {
      if (state.done) {
        expect(state.matches('failure')).toBe(true)
        done()
      }
    })
    .start()
})
```

We can then focus on each service as another set of units to test.

### Important Considerations

Even though XState is an awesome tool there are some aspects to consider when introducing it to your project.

#### It is too verbose for trivial things compared to traditional programming

The first stage of the machine is validating arguments which in traditional code it's just an `if/else` statement.

```javascript
if (!(await validateArgs(args)))
  return {
    /* ... */
  }

// vs.

const config = {
  // ...
  states: {
    validating: {
      invoke: {
        src: 'validateArgs',
        onDone: 'handlingThings',
        onError: {
          target: 'failure',
          actions: 'invalidArgsError',
        },
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
}
```

Reading our traditional function code in plain english:

> if arguments are not valid, return an error.

The state machine is a little more verbose:

> in the validating state, invoke `validateArgs`. On done, transition to the `handlingThings` state. On errror collect the errors and transition to the `failure` state.

Quite a mouthful for a trivial `if/else`, huh?

### Configuration over convention

From writing code to writing machine configurations. For some it may not be a big deal, but others may look at this as a crutch.

### It is something new to learn

When I presented the real version of this state machine to my team there were some that were against it because it is something new to learn.

I don't think XState is a trivial thing to learn as it did take me quite some trial and error to get to a point that I felt like I understood how to build and read these machine configurations.

## Closing thoughts

XState allowed me to tackle this issue from another angle than what I am accustomed to. I wrote my logic and stubbed my calls with plain strings and later I just added my services object to my machine config with real calls.

Thinking on problems this way made me think of all possible outcomes in advance and how to properly handle them rather than finding out halfway.

The actual machine that I wrote was nothing like this. It took a lot of trial and error to get it to a shape that made sense and my team would find acceptable.

When I presented the first iteration of my machine it was over complicated. I was asked to walk through it over Zoom with the whole team and I decided to build it from scratch and live on the XState visualizer.

The whole experience was very engaging and I actually had a couple of team members jump in and pointed out flaws in my logic. I had never thought that this would result in a code pairing session! In the end, we were all able to build something that we thought would make our logic better as team.

This is the actual machine we all built together, and the one this example oversimplified.

<XStateViz gist="dd58134a96f286bb06c3367952c4c001" />

I inlined actions to keep track of errors and successful jobs, which I would use in other places and add to my testing cases.
