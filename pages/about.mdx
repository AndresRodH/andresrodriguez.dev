# About Me

My full name is **Andrés Enrique Rodríguez Hernández** and I'm a software engineer. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela 🇻🇪 in 1993. I graduated from school in 2011 and enrolled in the Simón Bolívar University to pursue a degree in Applied Mathematics. However, due to several sociopolitical issues and a series of [pacific protests that ended up in tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Venezuelan_protests) my classes were interrupted very frequently.

The situation in Venezuela was -- and still is -- dangerous and unstable, so I decided to pursue my higher education in the United States. I got a grant and went to [Lindenwood University](https://www.lindenwood.edu/) where I met the love of my life and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 06, 2017.

Currently I work as a Software Engineer at [Coolfire](https://www.coolfiresolutions.com/). I started as a frontend developer in June 12, 2017 where I worked with several tools in the React ecosystem and I am currently working as part of the Core API team.

I now live with my wife Mirella in Missouri with our baby Sofía 🧔🏻👩🏻👶🏻.
